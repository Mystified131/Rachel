Short Prose Dream 20210102192921613835

I am sure that most disabled people would like to transcend their condition(s), and to be regarded as valued people. I am happy about this, and I do indeed hope that other disabled people get treated with respect and decency. Even people without the gene for mental illness admit that recreational drugs can blur the line between reality and illusion. I am happy about this, and I do indeed hope that other disabled people get treated with respect and decency. I wonder if I am the only one, if schizophrenics are the only people, to notice that unhealthy relationships with pleasure, pleasure-seeking and the way the mind experiences these things, has a negative effect on one's emotional and/or mental life? Although I am schizophrenic, I still need to work hard, pay my bills and taxes, and live up to my various obligations. Yet, I have to survive in this complex and ever-changing world. Whether healthy or schizophrenic, modern life's tendency to repeat itself, to run in cycles, is very much a part of human experience. 
Frozen Burritos Alas, as an isolated schizophrenic, not only was I poor, but often lacking in judgement. If anyone wondered why schizophrenics tend to life shorter lives- well, it's not mental or emotional. 
Whether healthy or schizophrenic, modern life's tendency to repeat itself, to run in cycles, is very much a part of human experience. Frozen Burritos Alas, as an isolated schizophrenic, not only was I poor, but often lacking in judgement. As a schizophrenic, if I can distinguish my own mind and body from that of God, I can more readily understand the world around me, the people in it, and the universe at large. The aliens represented our terror of a Russian invasion. Musique Concrete As a schizophrenic, I might ask- what is reality? As a schizophrenic, I have trained myself to doubt my senses. That mental illness does not have to mean that a patient's life is completely or permanently compromised. I believe that mental illness will continue to be perceived as a peripheral phenomenon- that schizophrenics, for example, will be seen as sick or maladjusted, at least to some degree. True, as well, that with mental acuity, persistence, technology and other attributes, they can achieve great things. The strong survive and thrive, while our planet slowly teeters towards ruin. The strong survive and thrive, while our planet slowly teeters towards ruin. The point is that schizophrenia, and other mental illnesses, don't necessarily mean that a person can't be reasonable, responsible or constructive. Musique Concrete As a schizophrenic, I might ask- what is reality? As a schizophrenic, I have trained myself to doubt my senses. A theory of mental illness might be, what if this experience with time is misinterpreted? The experience of tripping on acid can be very powerful, at times terrifying, and is definitely not recommended for people who are mentally ill (or who have mental illness in their families). I can't help but to wonder how true this is for so many mentally ill or other disabled people, as well as the elderly and others pushed to the periphery of our culture. Taken one way, these are symptoms of mental illness. Though it is said that I have a mental illness, a subjective view rather suggests that my reality is still my own and is therefore genuine, as much as anyone else's. I have a high iq and and a great problem solver. 
Schizophrenia And Modernity I wanted to mention an interesting paradox created by mental illness. When I moved on to working part-time, my contact with the everyday world, though awkward and stressful at times, was very helpful. I am highly able, though schizophrenic, and I know many others who are, as well. This comes from a paranoid schizophrenic, so you may choose to dismiss it. As a schizophrenic, if I can distinguish my own mind and body from that of God, I can more readily understand the world around me, the people in it, and the universe at large. Although I am schizophrenic, I still need to work hard, pay my bills and taxes, and live up to my various obligations. Schizophrenia And Intimacy One of the main casualties of mental illness can be intimacy. 
Perhaps, though, they could admit that what pain there is is sometimes needed to produce clarity- to survive in a complex and changing environment. I can't help but to wonder how true this is for so many mentally ill or other disabled people, as well as the elderly and others pushed to the periphery of our culture. 

Though it is said that I have a mental illness, a subjective view rather suggests that my reality is still my own and is therefore genuine, as much as anyone else's. A theory of mental illness might be, what if this experience with time is misinterpreted? That mental illness does not have to mean that a patient's life is completely or permanently compromised. If they know there is a mental health issue, this becomes a trait that is hard not to consider. I can confirm that a whole life can be achieved by a person who has a mental illness. Terrible to say, but when a person has a debilitating mental illness, it can be quite a blow to self-esteem. There are those who, publicly or privately, might judge or treat disabled people like they are less than normal, less than human. The experience of tripping on acid can be very powerful, at times terrifying, and is definitely not recommended for people who are mentally ill (or who have mental illness in their families). On The Dole When I learned that I would be able to survive on SSDI (Disability Benefits), I was, at first, relieved.

Frozen Burritos Alas, as an isolated schizophrenic, not only was I poor, but often lacking in judgement. I wonder if I am the only one, if schizophrenics are the only people, to notice that unhealthy relationships with pleasure, pleasure-seeking and the way the mind experiences these things, has a negative effect on one's emotional and/or mental life? Although I am schizophrenic, I still need to work hard, pay my bills and taxes, and live up to my various obligations. This comes from a paranoid schizophrenic, so you may choose to dismiss it. Whether healthy or schizophrenic, modern life's tendency to repeat itself, to run in cycles, is very much a part of human experience. Even people without the gene for mental illness admit that recreational drugs can blur the line between reality and illusion. The experience of tripping on acid can be very powerful, at times terrifying, and is definitely not recommended for people who are mentally ill (or who have mental illness in their families).

I believe that mental illness will continue to be perceived as a peripheral phenomenon- that schizophrenics, for example, will be seen as sick or maladjusted, at least to some degree.
